    <h4> Website Tasks </h4>

    <p> Just a website where I'm trying out things for now. <br>
         Eventually, I would like to do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href = #resume >Put up my resume</a></li>
        <li> Put up a brief bio</li>
        <li> Put up my portfolio, with links to my compiled projects and source code</li>
        <li> Put up links to my itch.io page ang Github page</li>
    </ul>




    <h4> Projects </h4>

    <p>
         Here's a list of projects I want in my portfolio:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Command-Line RPG Battle Simulator (Completed)</li>
        <li> Command-Line Snake (Completed) </li>
        <li> Game Jam Deep Sea Diver (Completed)</li>
        <li class = "uncompleted-item"> Game Jam GMTK (Uncompleted)</li>
        <li class = "uncompleted-item"> Open GL Audio Visualizer (Uncompleted)</li>
        <li class = "uncompleted-item"> Mobile Game Rocket Golf (Uncompleted)</li>
    </ol>




    <p> So it looks like you can write text in the body without paragraph tags. However, <br>
        paragraph tags automatically add space before and after the the text enclosed in <br>
        them. So it's a good idea to use them!
    </p>




    <h4> Learning Goals </h4>

    <p> And here's yet another list detailing my current learning plans:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li id = "current-learning-list">HTML + Github Pages (Portfolio) </li>
        <li class = "uncompleted-item"> Algorithms (Khan Academy) + Audio Visualizer (Project in JUCE) </li>
        <li class = "uncompleted-item"> Javascript (React) + Mobile Game (Project in Unity)</li>
        <li class = "uncompleted-item"> OpenGL + Musescore (Open-Source Project) </li>
    </ol>

    <a href = test_page.html> Test Link </a>

    <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
